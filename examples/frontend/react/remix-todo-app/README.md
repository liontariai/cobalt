# Remix Example Todo App with Cobalt

This is an example showing how you can easily use cobalt to build a react web app.

The cobalt server part is located in `app/server` and you can run it with `bun cobalt` in watch mode.

To start the remix app in dev mode run `bun dev`.

**Make sure you run `bun cobalt` first, because it will also emits a Samarium SDK that's being used in the frontend.**
